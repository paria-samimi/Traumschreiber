0.3.3

works:
	fetching AD data
		from all 3 AD's in parallel
		in 32 Byte packets each
		if data from all 3 is there and send buffer has space: try to filter/encode, write to send buffer and then send
	sending via BLE
		only fetching/sending if other device is connected and has enabled notifications on all three characteristics (both nicely triggered on BLE-events)
		in 30 Byte packets (unless Bits/channel is increased. Adds 3 Bytes per Bit.)
		trying to send on each recieved AD packet, unless >1 samples/package is defined.
			buffer-full check is now dirty (just checks if there is at least 10 packets read capacity plus new package and ignores write capacity)
	filtering
		biquad cascade IIR filters from arm_math package for M4
			two instances per channel
				low pass and (50Hz) notch @ 500Hz
				high pass @ 167Hz 
				coefficients (and order) are configurable via config characteristic
		turned on by default, circumvented if dummy data is transmitted
	encoding
		put all 24 channels in 1 package as difference (dcpm) values with 10Bit each
			amount of Bits can be increased
			values are shifted (aka least significant Bits are dropped) according to current variance
			amount of shifting is pushed out via 'C0DE' characteristic every second as notification
				also includes, how many packages have been dropped since the last C0DE update
				C0DE updates have priority over regular packages (but old ones are pushed out first)
	dummy data generation
		can be toggeled via config characteristic (see below)
		data gets generated every time a sample from the ADs come in
		only generates on first 8 channels
	battery reading
		works now
		AUXAIN register of AD1 (of 0-2) is read and written into byte 3&4 of config characteristic
		happens at startup and if notifications are disabled on one characteristic (of 4)
	configuration characteristic, 8 Bytes total (default setting for each Byte in parenthesis)

constraints:
	datarate: sampled down from 500 to 167Hz
		167Hz of packages is send
error output
	LED 18 is turned on when a packet is dropped internally and turned off again when one is succesfully cued
	LED 20 is turned on when AD0 is signalling available data und turned on once internal processing starts (after SPI transfer).
